One day my youTube feed started to fill with videos on the Enigma machine, Alan Turing, and the efforts to break the Enigma code during World War II.
I started to read in to it, I watched "The Imitation Game" on amazon prime, and then I decided that the Enigma machine was a cool project to try to implement as a program.
